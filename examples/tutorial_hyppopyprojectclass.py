# In this tutorial we demonstrate the HyppopyProject class usage

# import the HyppopyProject class
from hyppopy.HyppopyProject import HyppopyProject

# To configure a solver we need to instanciate a HyppopyProject class.
# This class can be configured using a nested dict. This dict has two
# obligatory  sections, hyperparameter and settings. A hyperparameter
# is described using a dict containing a section, data and type field
# and thus the hyperparameter section is a collection of hyperparameter
# dicts. The settings section keeps solver settings. These might depend
# on the solver used and need to be checked for each. E.g. Randomsearch,
# Hyperopt and Optunity need a solver setting max_iterations, the Grid-
# searchSolver don't.
config = {
"hyperparameter": {
    "C": {
        "domain": "uniform",
        "data": [0.0001, 20],
        "type": float
    },

        "domain": "uniform",
        "data": [0.0001, 20.0],

        "data": ["linear", "sigmoid", "poly", "rbf"],
        "type": str
    }},
    "max_iterations": 500
}

# When creating a HyppopyProject instance we
# pass the config dictionary to the constructor.
project = HyppopyProject(config=config)

# When building the project programmatically we can also use the methods
# add_hyperparameter and add_settings
project = HyppopyProject()
project.add_hyperparameter(name="C", domain="uniform", data=[0.0001, 20], dtype="float")
project.add_hyperparameter(name="kernel", domain="categorical", data=["linear", "sigmoid"], dtype="str")
project.set_settings(max_iterations=500)

# The custom section can be used freely
project.add_setting("my_var", 10)

# Settings are automatically transformed to member variables of the project class with the section as prefix
if project.max_iterations < 1000 and project.my_var == 10:
