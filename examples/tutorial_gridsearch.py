# In this tutorial we solve an optimization problem using the GridsearchSolver
# Gridsearch is very inefficient a Randomsearch might most of the time be the
# better choice.

# To configure the GridsearchSolver we only need the hyperparameter section. Another
# difference to the other solvers is that we need to define a gridsampling in addition
# to the range: 'data': [0, 1, 100] which means sampling the space from 0 to 1 in 100
# intervals. Gridsearch also supports categorical, uniform, normal and lognormal sampling

# When creating a HyppopyProject instance we
# pass the config dictionary to the constructor.
project = HyppopyProject(config=config)

# Hyppopy offers a class called BlackboxFunction to wrap your problem for Hyppopy.
# The function signature is as follows:
# BlackboxFunction(blackbox_func=None,
#                  dataloader_func=None,
#                  preprocess_func=None,
#                  callback_func=None,
#                  data=None,
#                  **kwargs)
#
# Means we can set a couple of function pointers, a data object and an arbitrary number of custom parameter via kwargs.
#
# - blackbox_func: a function pointer to the actual, user defined, blackbox function that is computing our loss
# - dataloader_func: a function pointer to a function handling the dataloading
# - preprocess_func: a function pointer to a function automatically executed before starting the optimization process
# - callback_func: a function pointer to a function that is called after each iteration with the trail object as input
# - data: setting data can be done via dataloader_func or directly
# - kwargs are passed to all functions above and thus can be used for parameter sharing between the functions
#
# (more details see in the documentation)
#
# Below we demonstrate the usage of all the above by defining a my_dataloader_function which in fact only grabs the
# iris dataset from sklearn and returns it. A my_preprocess_function which also does nothing useful here but
# demonstrating that a custom parameter can be set via kwargs and used in all of our functions when called within
# Hyppopy. The my_callback_function gets as input the dictionary containing the state of the iteration and thus can be
# used to access the current state of each solver iteration. Finally we define the actual loss_function
# my_loss_function, which gets as input a data object and params. Both parameter are fixed, the first is defined by
# the user depending on what is dataloader returns or the data object set in the constructor, the second is a dictionary
# with a sample of your hyperparameter space which content is in the choice of the solver.
